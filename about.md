# Welcome to the skyscapeR app
v0.4.1b (20 IV 2017) -- beta build

**skyscapeR** is an online app focused on the visualization and analysis of archaeoastronomical data. It is built in [_R_](https://www.r-project.org) using [_RStudio_](https://www.rstudio.com) and [_Shiny_](https://shiny.rstudio.com). It also uses the _R_ packages [_astrolibR_](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/astrolibR/index.html) and [_palinsol_](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/palinsol/index.html) for its astronomical calculations.
